    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>What is Currency Arbitrage?</h3>
    <p>
      Currency arbitrage is a financial strategy that exploits differences in currency exchange
      rates in various markets to make a profit. It involves buying a currency in one market at
      a lower rate and simultaneously selling it in another market at a higher rate. This
      discrepancy in exchange rates can occur due to differences in market efficiencies, timing
      delays between market updates, or variations in supply and demand across different
      geographical locations.
    </p>
    <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
    <p>
      Interestingly, Bellman-Ford's single-source shortest path algorithm can be used to detect
      artbitrage. Each currency represents a node in a directed graph, and the exchange rates are
      the weights of the graph. However, instead of using the pure exchange rates, we take the
      negative logrithm as the weights. Essentially, an arbitrage occurs when the product of a
      cycle of currencies ends up being more than 1. And since Bellman-Ford is adept at finding
      negative-weight cycles, a negative-weight cycle in this case would indicate that there exists
      a cycle of currencies whose product is greater than one, thereby indicating an arbitrage.

    <h2>Simulator</h2>
    <p>
      Initially, I wanted to create this project using real-time curency data. However, I quickly
      realized that all the available APIs needed a subscription. So I just created a simulator
      where you can enter in currency pairs and the website will let you know if you have a
      currency arbitrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try entering in USD/GBP = 0.9 and GPD/USD = 1.3. You will find that this result gives you an
      arbitrage because if you start with USD$1 to GBP$0.9 back to USD$1.17, you will have made
      17 cents for free!
